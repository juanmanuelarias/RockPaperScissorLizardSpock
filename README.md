# Kata

This is a kata for the game Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock, which was used for a TDD training at my Company.

The game game is coded on:

## .NET

The solution is a class library using MSTest as testing framework.

Then a MVC project was added with SignalR to use websocket capabilities and play a little bit.

## JavaScript

The solution is for JavaScript and contains:
* Pure JavaScript objects
* TypeScript object

The testing framework is _Jasmine_ 

The automation is made with _grunt_, which compiles TypeScript and run all the Unit Tests

No UI at the moment.
