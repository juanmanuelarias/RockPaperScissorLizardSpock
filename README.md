# Kata

This is a kata for the game Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock, which was used for a TDD training at my Company.

The game game is coded on:

## .NET

The solution is a class library using MSTest as testing framework.

Then a MVC project was added with SignalR to use websocket capabilities and play a little bit.

## JavaScript

The solution is pure JavaScript, using _Jasmine_ as testing framework and _grunt_ to run the tests.

No UI at the moment.
